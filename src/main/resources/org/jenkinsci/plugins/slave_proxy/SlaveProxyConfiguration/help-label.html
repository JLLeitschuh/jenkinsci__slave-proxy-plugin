<div>
    Specify the label expression (including just a slave name) that can be used as a tunneling
    point for the HTTP proxy to use (for example, just <tt>slave1</tt>, maybe <tt>slave1||slave2||slave3</tt>,
    or even <tt>sfbayarea</tt>)

    <p>
    If the label expression matches multiple slaves, the HTTP proxy will become more highly available.
    If one of the slaves goes down, the HTTP proxy will automatically switch over.
